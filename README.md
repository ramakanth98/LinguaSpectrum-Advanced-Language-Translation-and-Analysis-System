Parts of Natural Language Processing and Post Processing of text/corpus implements the translations and detection techniques before parsing. This project covers the major language processing functionalities in the form of APIs. We have created a visual representation of this APIs for the users to utilize the features. The features are self explanatory and simple to use.
